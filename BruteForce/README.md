# bruteforceftp

bruteforceftp.py

This script: 
- imports the socket, re, and sys librarys and asks for an ip address that we will attempt to brute force.  
- it creates a connection TCP/IP socket connection. 
- next it loops to send username and password combinations 
- in this example the script will attempt to connect to the ftp protocol on metasploitable.
- passwords consist of a list of commonly used passwords.
