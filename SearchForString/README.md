# searchforstring

searchforstring.py

This script: 
- Searches for a given string from all the files present in a given directory.
- Enter the string you want to find.    
- Enter the path to the directory where you want to perform the search.
- If the string is present in any readable file, then the output will list all applicable files.
- If the string is NOT present in any readable file, then print the message as such.
